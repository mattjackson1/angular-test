# angular test for Kisanhub

I've chosen to create a client-executed app, rather than compiling in node.
Also chose to restrict the entire app to a single file for simplicity - this is not best practise in the wild, where styles and script would be abstracted to their own files, but I thought in this instance, it was best.
